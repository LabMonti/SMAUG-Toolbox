# SMAUG-Toolbox
Single Molecule Analysis Unified Graphical (SMAUG) Toolbox

This software package contains a suite of graphical analysis tools for analyzing single molecule distance/conductance breaking trace data, including Segment Clustering as described in Bamberger et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c03612).  

Major update May 2021: a new and powerful suite of grid-based analysis tools, described in Bamberger et al. 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13521), is now integrated into this software package.

New users should start by reading the "START_HERE.pdf" document found in SMAUG-Toolbox/Documentation.

Make sure to also check out our sister repository at github.com/LabMonti/ImageChargeCalculations_ForSingleMoleculeJunctions; this software package can be used to model the renormalization of the transport levels of an individual molecule between two electrodes due to image charge effects, and was used for the image charge calculations in https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08662.
