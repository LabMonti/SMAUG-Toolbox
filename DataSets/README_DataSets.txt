For demonstration purposes we have included one example MCBJ experimental dataset here.  This dataset contains traces from an OPV3-2BT-F data (dataset ID# 96 in Bamberger et al. 2020).  Unfortunately, due to GitHub file size constraints we could not upload the entire dataset.  The copy here therefore only includes the first 1200 of 2147 total traces, and has also been converted from a "ExcludeTrailingNoise" to a "ChopFirstCross" chop method to reduce the number of data points included in each trace.  

We have also included an example here of a "dataset library", a flexible spreadsheat to hold information about lots of different datasets which can then be used by SMAUG functions to easily load specific datasets or find all datasets meeting certain criteria.
